Exercise 1

I used HTML to put all the data within tables and arranged them with CSS in a way I found to be efficient.

Exercise 2

I used data and an image from Cadillac, entered that info into my HTML file, and then styled those elements with CSS. I tried to match the colors of my elements with the image I used in order to make it aesthetically appealing. 

Exercise 3

I created a navbar and added a button which contained additional links. When the button is clicked, it expands to show the other links. I styled everything using css, including hover effects. I then added Javascript to toggle the dropdown menu on the button. The only issue I ran into was that when the dropdown menu expands, my entire navbar expands with it, which isn't what I intended. After perusing StackOverflow and trying different solutions (changing the position (static, absolute, relative) of the dropdown/dropdown content, the issue still persisted.
